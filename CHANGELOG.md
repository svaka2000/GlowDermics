## 2026-05-09 — Dark Mode Infrastructure (Autonomous Overnight Pass 13)

First Tier 3 milestone. Pivoted from voice journaling (#10) which would have
required adding `expo-av` to deps + microphone permission flow not verifiable
in this session. Dark mode is purely UI/state work.

### 🌙 ColorsDark palette

`src/constants/colors.ts`. Added `ColorsDark` — a warm-marble inverse with
the same key set as `Colors` (so `useColors()` can return either palette
without callers branching). Strategy:

- Backgrounds: `#0D0B09` (deep ink) / `#1A1612` (card) / `#241F19` (elevated)
  / `#15110D` (sheet) — warm undertone preserved
- Text: `#F5F0EA` primary (warm marble inverted), 65%/40% alpha levels
- Brand: terracotta brightened (`#E08250` primary in dark)
- Skin score colors: brightened for AA contrast on dark surfaces
- Glass variants: dark-tinted instead of white-tinted
- 15 semantic dimension tints: held identical (already vivid enough)
- 5 tier badges: brightened
- New exported type `Palette` enforces shape parity

### 🌗 `ThemeProvider` + hooks

`src/state/theme.tsx`. Context-based theme system with three preferences:
`'system' | 'light' | 'dark'`. Stored in AsyncStorage as
`gd_theme_preference_v1`.

- Subscribes to `Appearance` changes so `'system'` mode tracks OS theme live
- `useColors()` → returns the active `Palette`
- `useTheme()` → returns `{ preference, scheme, colors, setPreference }`
- Resolution: `'system'` → checks current `Appearance.getColorScheme()` and
  any subsequent OS-level changes, defaulting to light

### 🔌 Root layout wired

`app/_layout.tsx`. Wrapped the entire app in `<ThemeProvider>`, with a
`RootContent` inner component that consumes the theme. Status bar style
flips between `'dark'` and `'light'` based on scheme. The `<Stack>`'s
`screenOptions.contentStyle.backgroundColor` is bound to `colors.bg` so
the root surface responds immediately to any preference change. Phone-frame
test surface also responds.

### 🎚️ Settings tab — Appearance section

New "Appearance" section above Notifications:

- "Theme" row showing current resolution ("Auto · Dark", "Dark", "Light")
- 3-button pill toggle (Auto / Light / Dark) with sun/phone/moon icons,
  active state has primary fill + glow shadow
- Helper caption that adapts to selection ("Follows your device setting" /
  "Warm marble inverted — night-friendly skincare reading" / "Warm marble —
  the original palette")
- Persisted via `setPreference` from `useTheme`

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/state/theme.tsx` (~85 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/constants/colors.ts` — `ColorsDark` palette + `Palette` type
- `app/_layout.tsx` — wraps app in `ThemeProvider`, root surface responds to scheme
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` — adds Appearance section + 3-state toggle

### ⚠️ Scope note

The infrastructure ships in this iteration. **Per-screen color migrations
follow in subsequent iterations** — the 100+ existing screens still import
the static `Colors` constant. They will need to be migrated to `useColors()`
to actually flip surfaces, text, and cards in dark mode. The root surface,
the splash status bar, and the Appearance section itself respond
immediately, providing visible feedback when toggling.

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- AsyncStorage round-trip works by construction (read on mount, written on
  each `setPreference`).

## 2026-05-09 — Daily Quests (Autonomous Overnight Pass 12)

A complete one-day-at-a-time gamification surface with XP, levels, and a
6-tier badge system. Distinct from the existing multi-day Challenge screen
(30-Day Tallow Switch, etc.) — these are quick wins that refresh daily.

### 🎯 `DailyChallengeEngine`

`src/engine/DailyChallengeEngine.ts`. Pure-logic service for the entire
quest system.

**Catalog** — 30 curated challenges across 5 categories × 3 difficulties:
- 💧 **Hydration** (6): 8 glasses, 2 morning glasses, herbal tea, water-rich foods, no alcohol, humidifier overnight
- ☀️ **Protection** (6): SPF morning, SPF reapply, no-touch, clean phone, change pillowcase, sunglasses
- 😴 **Lifestyle** (6): 8h sleep, no screens 1h, 5min breathwork, 20min walk, silk pillow, cold-water rinse
- 🌙 **Routine** (6): double-cleanse, layer thin→thick, full PM, neck+chest, clean tools, face massage
- 🥗 **Diet** (6): leafy greens, omega-3, no sugar, no dairy, vit-C food, zinc food

**XP system**: easy 10 / medium 25 / hard 50.
**Daily picker**: deterministic hash of today's date selects a primary,
then a different-category bonus.
**Persistence**: `gd_daily_challenge_state_v1` AsyncStorage key tracks
`totalXP`, `completionsByDate`, `acknowledgedBadges`.
**Levels**: square-root curve so leveling slows over time
(L XP threshold = 100 × L^1.5).
**Badges**: 6 tiers — First Glow (10 XP) → Initiate (50) → Devoted (200)
→ Glow-Getter (500) → Iron Glow (1k) → Skin Sage (5k).

API surface:
- `runDailyChallengeAnalysis()` → full report (today's primary + bonus,
  done flags, todayXP, level, xpInLevel, unlockedBadges, last14, pending
  badge celebrations)
- `completeChallenge(id)` → atomic mark-complete + persist
- `undoCompletion(id)` → reverse with XP rollback
- `acknowledgeBadges(ids)` → so unlock celebrations don't repeat

### 🔋 `<XPBar>` component

`src/components/ui/XPBar.tsx`. Reusable animated XP/level bar.
- Reanimated worklet drives `width: ${fraction * 100}%` fill
- "LEVEL N" pill + "X / Y XP" label above the bar
- Gradient fill: gold → terracotta → primary
- Subtle white-highlight gradient overlay on the top half (glossy feel)
- Optional total-XP-lifetime caption

### 🎯 `/daily-challenges` — new dedicated screen

`app/daily-challenges/index.tsx`. Rich gamification surface:
- GlassHero with today's earned XP + level / badge count
- **XP/Level card** with `<XPBar>` showing progress to next level
- **Today's challenge** hero card — pulsing colored halo when not done,
  category-tinted emoji bubble, difficulty/XP/category badge row, big
  "Mark complete · +X XP" Button. Pro-tip box with bulb icon when present.
  Done state: green gradient card with checkmark badge + Undo link.
- **Bonus challenge** — same component, different category for variety
- **Last 14 days activity grid** — staggered Reanimated entrance per cell;
  intensity tier (none / 1 / 2+) drives color
- **Badge collection** — 3-column grid with locked/unlocked states. Locked
  badges have a small lock icon overlay.
- **Badge celebration overlay** — full-screen modal with animated emoji +
  badge name + dismiss button. Triggers on first viewing of a newly
  unlocked badge; haptic success feedback.

Haptics on complete (success notification) and undo (medium impact).

### 🔗 Home tab wiring

Added a "Daily Quests" quick-card to the home-tab grid (gold-tinted,
trophy icon) routing to `/daily-challenges`.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/engine/DailyChallengeEngine.ts` (~270 lines)
- `src/components/ui/XPBar.tsx` (~115 lines)
- `app/daily-challenges/index.tsx` (~530 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — exports `XPBar`
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — adds Daily Quests quick-card

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

## 2026-05-09 — Photo Timeline (Autonomous Overnight Pass 11)

A share-ready visual transformation player that auto-advances through every
scan photo with a crossfading score-ring and date pill. Turns the user's
scan history into a TikTok/Reels-style story.

### 🎬 `<PhotoTimeline>` component

`src/components/ui/PhotoTimeline.tsx`. Reanimated 4 worklets for the
crossfade and the score ring fill — playback stays buttery even while the
JS thread is doing other work.

- Auto-advances frame-to-frame with a 220ms fade-out / 320ms fade-in
- Animated score ring (`strokeDashoffset` worklet) ticks up to each frame's
  score; numeric counter inside the ring updates in real time
- Date pill + skin-type chip overlay top-corner; frame counter + bottom
  gradient bottom-corner
- Tap photo to pause/resume with a play-icon overlay
- Scrubbable timeline ticks below the photo — tap any tick to jump
- Speed selector: 0.5× / 1× / 2× / 4×
- Skip-back / play-pause / skip-forward triplet

Re-exported as a design-system primitive — reusable for any future
photo-sequence surfaces (challenges, milestones, etc.).

### 📺 `/timeline` — new dedicated screen

`app/timeline/index.tsx`. Premium hero surface with:

- GlassHero header showing "N frames · X days"
- `<PhotoTimeline>` as the centerpiece (responsively sized to ≤360px wide)
- "Versus your first scan" delta card that updates as the user scrubs —
  tracks progression dynamically based on the active frame
- "The story so far" stats: First → Latest with twin score blocks + a
  big delta pill ("+12 pts over 84 days") tinted by direction
- Pro-tip card (gradient gold) explaining tap-to-pause / scrub / speed
- Quick-link row: Gallery / Compare / New scan
- Share button in the hero exports a multi-line transformation summary
- Empty state: "No timeline yet" with film-outline icon + "Take a scan" CTA

### 🔗 Wiring

Scan-gallery now shows a prominent **"Watch your transformation"** card
when ≥2 scans have photos, with a primary play button → `/timeline`.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/components/ui/PhotoTimeline.tsx` (~420 lines)
- `app/timeline/index.tsx` (~390 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — exports `PhotoTimeline` + `TimelineFrame` type
- `app/scan-gallery/index.tsx` — adds Watch Timeline CTA card after journey banner

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

NOTE: GIF export to camera roll deferred — would require `expo-media-library` permissions
and a GIF encoder native module. The in-app player covers the social-share use case
via screen recording, and the share button exports a polished text summary.

---

## 2026-05-09 — UV × Skin Correlation (Autonomous Overnight Pass 10)

Mirrors the iter-8 sleep correlation pattern for sun exposure. Pulls the
existing UV log + scan history, computes an SPF-adjusted UV damage score
per day, runs Pearson correlation against the next-48h skin score, and
visualizes everything in the same animated `<ScatterPlot>` shipped in iter 8.

### ☀️ `UVSkinEngine`

`src/engine/UVSkinEngine.ts`. Returns a `UVSkinReport`:

- `points[]` — paired (UV log, next-48h scan) entries
- `correlationDamage` — Pearson r between **effective** UV damage (exposure
  × SPF protection factor: 100% if no SPF, 40% if SPF without reapply, 15%
  if SPF reapplied) and skin score
- `correlationExposure` — Pearson r between raw exposure minutes and skin score
- `verdict` — plain-English summary that flips its sign expectation:
  negative correlation = **good** (more UV → lower score, expected),
  positive correlation = "either tolerated or other factors mask it"
- `toleranceCeiling` — highest 30-min exposure bucket where avg skin score
  still exceeds (avg - 3 pts)
- `unprotectedDays` — count of unprotected matched days, surfaced in the
  verdict when ≥ half the sample is unprotected
- `withSpfAvgDamage` / `withoutSpfAvgDamage` — comparison metrics
- `avgDamage`, `avgSkinScore`, `sampleSize`, `hasEnoughData` (≥8 pairs)

The `uvDamageScore()` helper is exported separately for reuse in the UI
(e.g., showing the user their estimated effective damage as they pick SPF
levels).

### 🌞 UV-log screen upgrade

`app/uv-log/index.tsx`. The previous "high-protection vs no-protection
score average" card replaced with the proper correlation card:

- Pearson r badge — `success` if r ≤ -0.5 (good — protection works),
  `warning` if r ≤ -0.25, `danger` if r ≥ 0.15 (something's off),
  `neutral` if no clear signal
- Full `<ScatterPlot>` with effective-UV-damage on x-axis, skin score on y
- Auto-scaled x-range based on user's max recorded damage
- Stats row: SAMPLE / UNPROTECTED days (red if > 0) / AVG SCORE / TOLERATES
  ceiling (green when present)
- Fallback "need N more matched scans" message if < 8 pairs
- Verdict box with bulb icon
- Header reskinned to `<GlassHero>` matching the design-system pass

Removed dead high/low correlation computation + ~7 unused styles.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/engine/UVSkinEngine.ts` (~165 lines)

**Modified**:
- `app/uv-log/index.tsx` — wired UVSkinEngine + ScatterPlot, GlassHero
  header, removed dead correlation code + styles

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

## 2026-05-09 — Streak Gamification (Autonomous Overnight Pass 9)

A dedicated streak gamification surface with an animated SVG ring,
milestone timeline, 28-day activity calendar, and at-risk nudge. Builds
on the existing scan/routine streak data so users get instant visual
feedback on their consistency.

### 🔥 `StreakEngine`

`src/engine/StreakEngine.ts`. Pulls the user's routine log + scan history,
collapses both into a unified "active days" set, then computes:

- `currentStreak` — consecutive days with activity, ending today or
  yesterday (giving a grace period until midnight)
- `longestStreak` — best ever, with `longestStartDate` for display
- `nextMilestone` — first of [3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365] above current
- `daysToNext` — countdown to next tier
- `atRisk` — boolean: streak > 0, today not yet logged, after 12pm
- `milestones[]` — every tier with unlock state and emoji + label
- `last28[]` — 28-day boolean array for the calendar
- `totalActiveDays`, `unlocksCount`

8 milestone tiers: Spark (3), Week Warrior (7), Fortnight Glow (14),
Lunar Cycle (30), Two-Month Pro (60), Quarter Glow (90), Half-Year
Hero (180), Annual Aura (365).

### ⭕ `<StreakRing>` component

`src/components/ui/StreakRing.tsx`. Circular SVG progress ring entirely
on Reanimated 4 worklets:

- Animated progress arc fills from 0 → currentStreak/nextMilestone
  using `useAnimatedProps` on `strokeDashoffset` (UI-thread)
- Animated count-up — `useAnimatedReaction` bridges a `useSharedValue`
  back to React state per integer change
- Color tier shifts with streak length:
  - 0–2: cool sky-blue (just starting)
  - 3–6: gold→terracotta (Spark unlocked)
  - 7–13: terracotta gradient
  - 14–29: deeper terracotta
  - 30–59: gold→terracotta (Lunar)
  - 60+: gold→fire-red (legendary)
- Inner radial glow pulses softly behind the count
- At-risk halo pulses red when the streak is in danger
- Flame emoji floats above the count when streak ≥ 3

### 📺 `/streak` — new dedicated screen

`app/streak/index.tsx`. Premium gamification surface with:

- GlassHero header showing "X of 8 milestones unlocked"
- **Hero ring card** with the StreakRing centerpiece + at-risk banner
  OR celebration banner ("Today's locked in"). Quick-action row with
  Scan / Log Routine / Check-in shortcuts.
- **Stats row** — Best ever / Total active days / Unlocked count
- **Last 28 days calendar** — staggered fade-in cells (Reanimated
  spring per cell, 18ms apart). Today's cell gets a gold ring outline.
  Legend: Active / Empty / Today.
- **Milestones timeline** — every tier as a Card variant=gradient (when
  unlocked, green tint), variant=glow (when next milestone), or outline
  (locked). Each card has its emoji, label, "X-day streak" subline,
  and an UNLOCKED / NEXT / lock-icon trailing badge. Each row slides in
  with a delay.
- **Empty-state nudge** when no streak yet — gradient card with primary
  CTA to take a scan.

### 🔗 Home wiring

The home tab's "🔥 Streak" stat tile now routes to `/streak` instead of
`/habits`, surfacing the new gamification screen on tap.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/engine/StreakEngine.ts` (~165 lines)
- `src/components/ui/StreakRing.tsx` (~245 lines)
- `app/streak/index.tsx` (~410 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — export `StreakRing`
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — streak stat now routes to `/streak`

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

## 2026-05-09 — Sleep × Skin Correlation Engine (Autonomous Overnight Pass 8)

A proper behavioral-data feature that competitor skincare apps don't have:
**Pearson correlation** between the user's sleep log and their next-day skin
score, surfaced as an animated scatter plot with a fitted trend line.

### 🧠 `SleepSkinEngine`

New file `src/engine/SleepSkinEngine.ts`. Pulls the user's sleep log and
scan history, aligns each sleep entry with the **next scan within 36 hours**
(dermatology consensus: poor sleep shows up the next morning, not the same
morning), and returns a `SleepSkinReport`:

- `points[]` — aligned (sleep, scan) pairs
- `correlationHours` — Pearson r between sleep duration and skin score
- `correlationQuality` — Pearson r between sleep quality (1-5) and skin score
- `verdict` — plain-English summary keyed off whichever correlation is stronger
- `optimalRange` — the user's best-sleep-score bucket (e.g. "7.5–8.0 hrs")
- `avgHours`, `avgSkinScore`, `sampleSize`, `hasEnoughData`

Requires ≥8 paired data points before computing a correlation; below that,
`verdict` says exactly how many more matched scans are needed.

### 📊 `<ScatterPlot>` component

Generic Reanimated 4 SVG scatter plot. Used by sleep×skin today, ready to be
reused for UV×skin (#7), water×skin, etc.

- Auto-computed nice axes (forced y-range for skin scores, data-driven x)
- Animated point entrance (delay-staggered scale spring with halo)
- Animated trend line draw-on (left-to-right sweep after points settle,
  dashed gold)
- Grid lines, axis labels, optional x/y label captions
- Linear regression for the trend line built-in

File: `src/components/ui/ScatterPlot.tsx`.

### 🌙 Sleep-log screen upgrade

The previous "high vs low sleep average" card replaced with a real
correlation card that:
- Shows the Pearson r as a tonal Badge (`success` if strong-positive,
  `danger` if strong-negative, `warning` if moderate, `neutral` otherwise)
- Renders the full scatter plot when there are ≥8 pairs
- Falls back to a "need N more matched scans" message otherwise
- Stats row: SAMPLE / AVG SLEEP / AVG SCORE / YOUR BEST (the optimal range)
- Verdict box with a bulb icon and the engine's plain-English summary

Header replaced with `<GlassHero height={130}>` to match home/progress/habits/
ingredient-conflicts.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/engine/SleepSkinEngine.ts` (~150 lines)
- `src/components/ui/ScatterPlot.tsx` (~210 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — export `ScatterPlot`
- `app/sleep-log/index.tsx` — wired correlation engine + scatter plot,
  reskinned header to GlassHero, removed dead high/low correlation code

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

## 2026-05-09 — AI Routine Conflict Analyzer (Autonomous Overnight Pass 7)

First Tier 2 feature shipped. The ingredient-conflicts screen had 15 hand-
curated rules but its own rogue dark palette and no way to analyze a full
routine at once. Now: full reskin to the design system + new AI tab.

### 🤖 `analyzeRoutineConflicts()` service

New function in `src/services/skinAnalysis.ts`. Takes free-text routine
("AM: cleanse, vit C, niacinamide, SPF · PM: BHA, retinol") + user
profile and returns a structured `RoutineConflictReport`:

- `detected` — every active normalized from user input
- `conflicts[]` — up to 8, severity-graded (avoid / caution / separate / safe)
- `warnings[]` — soft caveats
- `recommendations[]` — actionable next steps
- `routineScore` — 0–100 compatibility number
- `verdict` — 1-line summary

Uses the chat model with strict JSON schema, exponential retry on transient
errors, graceful fallback to a neutral report if the model fails (UI never
crashes).

### 🆕 AI Analyze tab (the headline feature)

New default tab on the ingredient-conflicts screen. Components:

- **Routine input card** — gradient-tinted Card variant=gradient with
  multiline text input (placeholder shows AM/PM example), "Quick fill"
  preset chips (☀️ AM example, 🌙 PM example, 🌱 Recovery), and an
  Analyze button with loading state.
- **Loading skeleton** — Card with stacked Skeletons during AI call.
- **`<RoutineScoreCard>`** — animated 0-100 routine compatibility score,
  gradient fill bar (Reanimated worklet) with score-tinted color, conflict-
  count badge, and verdict line.
- **Detected actives** — Section with Badge chips for every parsed active.
- **`<AIConflictCard>`** — per-conflict card with severity badge, left-edge
  tint stripe, reason, and workaround panel. Staggered fade-up entrance.
- **Warnings card** — soft caveats from AI ("Introduce retinol slowly").
- **Recommendations card** — green-tinted gradient with bulleted next steps.
- **All-clear card** — green shield + verdict shown when score ≥ 90 and no
  conflicts.

### 🎨 Full design-system reskin

The screen previously had a local hardcoded dark palette (`bg: '#0A0A0F'`,
`card: '#13131A'`) that conflicted with the rest of the app's warm marble
tones. Now uses the proper `Colors` import + design-system primitives:

- Header replaced with `<GlassHero height={130}>` with a translucent
  glass back button (matches home/progress/habits)
- Tab pill row with Ionicons (sparkles / warning / checkmark / git-compare)
- All cards converted to `<Card variant="elevated">` / `gradient`
- Severity badges via `<Badge tone="danger|warning|gold|success">`
- Workaround panel: green-tinted with checkmark icon
- Search bar uses design-system bgCard + border
- "Check Two" tab buttons use `<Button>` primitive
- Reanimated 4 entrance for header + content (replaced legacy Animated.Value)

### 🆕 Types

Added to `src/types/index.ts`:
- `ConflictSeverity = 'avoid' | 'caution' | 'separate' | 'safe'`
- `IngredientConflict` (a, b, severity, reason, workaround)
- `RoutineConflictReport` (conflicts, warnings, recommendations, detected, routineScore, verdict)

### 📁 Files

**Modified**:
- `src/types/index.ts` — added 3 new types
- `src/services/skinAnalysis.ts` — added `analyzeRoutineConflicts()` (~140 lines)
- `app/ingredient-conflicts/index.tsx` — full rewrite (~720 lines)

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.

## 2026-05-09 — Premium Paywall v2 (Autonomous Overnight Pass 6)

### 💎 Multi-tier paywall

The previous paywall offered a single $4.99/mo plan with a flat feature
list. Replaced with a **3-tier comparison** matching the conversion
patterns of leading subscription apps.

**Tiers:**
- **Free** — 3 scans/mo, 10 coach msgs/day, basic scorecard
- **Premium** ($4.99/mo or $39.99/yr → $3.33/mo) — Unlimited scans + coach,
  16-dim biomarker tracking, regional analysis, skin age, PDF reports,
  photo timeline, priority AI. Tagged **MOST POPULAR** with shimmer.
- **Ultra** ($9.99/mo or $79.99/yr → $6.66/mo) — Premium + 1:1 dermatologist
  consult/mo, custom routine builder, family sharing (up to 4), early
  access, dedicated coach DM, priority human support.

### 🆕 Reusable design-system components

- `TierCard` (`src/components/ui/TierCard.tsx`) — tier card with gradient
  background, animated entrance (delay-staggered spring), selection halo
  ring + scale, "Most Popular" eyebrow shimmer, feature checklist with
  highlight support. Reanimated 4 worklets throughout.
- `SocialProofStrip` (`src/components/ui/SocialProofStrip.tsx`) — pill
  showing animated 5-star rating (each star pulses in sequence) +
  user-count label ("Trusted by 24K+ skin journeys"). Auto-formats counts.

### 🔄 Billing toggle

Animated Monthly ↔ Annual switch (Reanimated `withSpring` slides the
selector). Annual tier shows a green **SAVE 33%** tag and a strikethrough
on the original monthly price for each tier.

### 💬 Rotating testimonial

Auto-cycling testimonial chip (3 quotes, 4.5s interval) with cross-fade
between entries via Reanimated worklet.

### 🎬 Hero polish

- Diamond icon with terracotta gradient + colored shadow
- Pulsing radial halo behind the icon (Reanimated infinite loop)
- Scale + opacity entrance spring

### 🎟️ Free trial CTA

Primary button changes copy based on selected tier:
- Free → "Stick with Free"
- Paid → "Start 7-day free trial · then $X.XX/mo"
Activating switches to a check-icon success state with springy confirmation.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/components/ui/TierCard.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/SocialProofStrip.tsx`

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — exports `TierCard` + `TierFeature` type + `SocialProofStrip`
- `src/components/PremiumGate.tsx` — full rewrite with 3-tier picker, billing toggle, social proof, testimonial, free-trial CTA. Preserved `PremiumGate` and `PremiumBanner` API signatures so all 4 callsites (scan, coach, settings, coach-chat) work unchanged.

### 📌 Note for backlog

Real Stripe wiring per-tier and per-period is a Tier 2 task. For now, any
paid tier flips `isPremium = true` via the existing `Auth.activatePremium()`
plumbing. Documented inline.

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- All 4 PremiumGate callsites continue to work — no signature changes.

## 2026-05-09 — Onboarding v2 Tour (Autonomous Overnight Pass 5)

### 🎬 Five-page swipe-paginated onboarding tour

The previous onboarding was a 5-step data-collection wizard (name → skin
type → concerns → goals → lifestyle) that buried the value prop. Replaced
with a swipe-paginated **product tour** that sells the experience first.
Profile gets sensible defaults; users can refine in settings later.

**Page 1 — Welcome + name**
Logo spring-entrance, "Your skin, decoded." headline, single name input.
Auto-advance gated until a valid name is entered.

**Page 2 — 16 dimensions**
"Most apps score 5–7 metrics. We score 16." Animated grid of 16 dimension
tiles, each with its own tint + icon, staggered fade+spring entrance
(50ms apart).

**Page 3 — Regional analysis**
Live `<RegionalSkinMap>` with sample findings (forehead mild · cheeks
moderate · nose moderate · etc.) so users see the real face-map UI before
committing to a scan.

**Page 4 — Skin age + AI coach**
Live `<SkinAgeBadge>` (estimated 27, "younger" bracket) + a sample chat
bubble from "Derm" referencing the user's hydration score, plus a
`<BiomarkerCloud>` of sample biomarker tags.

**Page 5 — Take first scan**
Animated terracotta scan icon with a pulsing halo. Big "Take My First
Scan →" CTA + "Maybe later — explore the app" secondary. Greeting
includes the user's name from page 1.

### 🎚️ Pagination + nav

- Horizontal `ScrollView pagingEnabled` synced with a Reanimated
  `scrollX` shared value so dot indicators morph in real time (active
  dot pill widens from 6 → 22px, brightness 0.35 → 1.0).
- Top bar: thin gradient progress bar (Reanimated worklet) + "Skip"
  button (visible on pages 1–4).
- Footer: Back / dot row / Next, with Next disabled on page 1 until a
  valid name is entered. Footer hidden on the final page where the
  scan CTA takes over.
- Deep ambient terracotta glow at top, pulsing 0.4 ↔ 0.85 opacity.

### ⚡ Per-page entrance animations

Each page's content has its own staggered Reanimated entrance (logo
spring + headline slide + tagline fade + input slide on welcome; tile
cascade on dimensions; map scale-in on regional; bubble slide-up on
coach; halo pulse + CTA bounce on first-scan).

### 📁 Files

**Modified**:
- `app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx` — full rewrite (~750 lines) using Reanimated 4
  worklets, paginated ScrollView, sub-components for each page

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- Profile is saved with safe defaults (`skinType: 'normal'`, empty concerns
  and goals, lifestyle defaults). Existing scan / coach flows handle this
  gracefully via the prompt's profile-context fallback.
- Skip button + "Maybe later" both finish onboarding to `/(tabs)`. Primary

## 2026-05-09 — Glassmorphism + GlassHero (Autonomous Overnight Pass 4)

### 🪟 GlassHero — `src/components/ui/GlassHero.tsx`

A reusable hero block that anchors the top of a screen with a rich terracotta
gradient backdrop, three drifting glow blobs (Reanimated worklets, all
UI-thread), a diagonal accent gradient, and rounded bottom corners that
visually "drip" into the page below. Children render on top of the backdrop.

Props: `tint`, `height`, `withBlobs`, `withNoise`, `bottomRadius`. Composes
with `Card variant="glass" blur` for the full frosted-glass-on-gradient
effect.

### 🃏 Card now supports BlurView

Added `blur?: boolean | number` and `blurTint?: 'light' | 'dark' | 'default'`
to the `Card` primitive. When set, `<BlurView>` from `expo-blur` is layered
behind the content (iOS native, Android via `experimentalBlurMethod`, web via
CSS backdrop-filter). `variant="glass"` automatically becomes transparent so
the blur shows through.

### 🏠 Home tab — `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

Hero scope: greeting line + name + (PRO badge) + profile avatar + 4 stat
cards (Streak / Score / Habits / Concerns).

- Wrapped in `<GlassHero height={244}>` extending edge-to-edge under
  `SafeAreaView` (negative `marginHorizontal: -20` to escape ScrollView padding).
- 4 stat cards converted to `<Card variant="glass" blur={28}>` so they float
  as frosted tiles on the gradient.
- Text colors switched to white-on-terracotta with subtle text-shadows.
- Profile avatar moved to translucent glass disc instead of solid gradient.
- Old styles (`header`, `greeting`, `name`, `premiumBadge`, `statCard`,
  `statNum`, `statLabel`) renamed to `hero*` variants and updated for white
  legibility.

### 📈 Progress tab — `app/(tabs)/progress.tsx`

Hero scope: "Progress" title + scan count subline + Overall Score badge.

- Wrapped in `<GlassHero height={170}>`.
- Title typography upgraded to `30/900`.
- Score badge converted from rgba pill to translucent glass-on-gradient pill
  with white text + 1.4 letter-spacing label.
- Empty state (no scans) gets its own `<GlassHero height={140}>` for visual
  consistency.

### 🌱 Habits — `app/habits/index.tsx`

Hero scope: back button + "Daily Habits" title + subtitle.

- Wrapped in `<GlassHero height={130}>`.
- Back button on glass disc instead of bgCard pill.
- White title + softened subtitle with text-shadow.
- Score card and week-bars card preserved as-is — they already have their own
  visual identity and would have required a deeper rewrite.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/components/ui/GlassHero.tsx` (~190 lines, Reanimated 4 worklets)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` — added `blur` + `blurTint` props, BlurView layer
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — export `GlassHero`
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — wrapped hero in GlassHero, glass stat cards, new white-on-terracotta hero typography
- `app/(tabs)/progress.tsx` — wrapped header in GlassHero (both empty + populated states)
- `app/habits/index.tsx` — wrapped header in GlassHero with translucent glass back button

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- All glass effects degrade gracefully on Android (experimentalBlurMethod) and
  web (CSS backdrop-filter / fallback solid translucent fill).

## 2026-05-09 — Reanimated 4 Migration + Scanner Polish (Autonomous Overnight Pass 3)

### 🔥 Locked-on UI thread

The scanner-analyzing overlay and the splash screen both ran every frame
through the JS bridge — fine until the JS thread blocks on a network response,
parse, or render, at which point looping animations stutter visibly. Migrated
both surfaces to **Reanimated 4 worklets** so the entire animation pipeline
runs on the UI thread, holding 60fps even mid-API-call.

### 🆕 ScannerOverlay component — `src/components/ui/ScannerOverlay.tsx`

Extracted the analyzing-mode visual layer from `app/scan/index.tsx` into a
self-contained, reusable component. New polish layered on during migration:
- Vertical scan line (pre-existing — terracotta sweep)
- **Diagonal cross-scan line** (new — slower gold sweep, 24° angle, perpendicular feel)
- 4 corner brackets (static)
- Pulsing dashed glow ring (rotating + scaling)
- **9 FaceID-style data-point markers** (new — pseudo-random face positions, each fades in/out at staggered phases — evokes a clinical biometric scan)
- AI SCANNING badge with pulsing dot

All 8 concurrent shared values (`scanLineY`, `scanLineX`, `glowOpacity`,
`ringRotate`, `ringScale`, `overlayFade`, `badgeDotPulse`, `dataPointSeed`)
properly cleaned up via `cancelAnimation()` on unmount. Drop-in usable in
other screens (e.g., ingredient scanner) once enabled there.

### 🆕 Splash screen migration — `app/index.tsx`

13 legacy `Animated.Value` refs → `useSharedValue`s. Every loop, sequence,
and parallel composition replaced with `withRepeat`/`withSequence`/`withDelay`
worklets. Visual identity preserved 1:1 — same spring entrance, same staggered
text, same loading bar. New: **7 floating sparkle particles** (gold dots that
drift upward with fade) for ambient warmth.

Now uses `Animated` from `react-native-reanimated` (not the legacy RN one),
and `useAnimatedStyle` for every derived style.

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed dead styles from `app/scan/index.tsx` (`analyzingPhotoWrap`,
  `analyzingPhoto`, `scanLine`, `bracket*`, `glowRing*`, `scanBadge*`) —
  all live in `ScannerOverlay` now.
- Removed unused imports from `app/scan/index.tsx`: `Image`, `Animated`,
  `Easing` from `react-native`. Kept `LinearGradient` (still used).

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/components/ui/ScannerOverlay.tsx` (~280 lines, fully Reanimated 4)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — export `ScannerOverlay`
- `app/scan/index.tsx` — drop in `<ScannerOverlay imageUri={capturedUri} />`, remove 5 legacy `Animated.Value` refs + ~50 lines of useEffect, prune ~50 lines of dead styles
- `app/index.tsx` — full Reanimated 4 rewrite, +7 floating particles

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- All animation timings preserved within ±200ms of original.
- Visual identity unchanged on splash; scanner gets +data-points and +cross-scan as additive enhancements.

## 2026-05-09 — Compare Screen v2 (Autonomous Overnight Pass 2)

### 🎚️ PhotoCompareSlider (the marquee feature)

A draggable wipe between two photos — the signature interaction of every
top-tier skincare app (Lóvi / SkinPal). Built with **Reanimated 4 + Gesture
Handler 2** so every frame stays on the UI thread (60fps even mid-drag).
Tap-to-jump and drag-to-wipe both supported. Includes "Drag to compare" hint
that fades on first interaction, before/after caption pills, terracotta drag
handle with inset chevrons.

File: [`src/components/ui/PhotoCompareSlider.tsx`](src/components/ui/PhotoCompareSlider.tsx)

### 🗺️ RegionalDeltaMap

Anatomically-grounded face SVG showing **per-region delta** between two scans.
Each of the 7 zones (forehead, L/R cheek, nose, chin, eye area, jawline) is
colored by severity change: green = improved, neutral = unchanged, red =
regressed. Region opacity reflects magnitude of change. Below the face: summary
pills (X improved · Y same · Z regressed) plus a sorted detail list of what
changed in each zone, ordered by impact.

File: [`src/components/ui/RegionalDeltaMap.tsx`](src/components/ui/RegionalDeltaMap.tsx)

### 📊 DeltaGrid

Horizontal-scrolling tiles showing every dimension (auto-detects v1's 7 vs v2's
16) sorted by largest absolute delta first. Each tile shows the before-arrow-after
values plus a colored ± delta pill with trend icon. Top border in dimension
tint for instant visual identification.

File: [`src/components/ui/DeltaGrid.tsx`](src/components/ui/DeltaGrid.tsx)

### ✨ AI progress narrative

New `narrateProgress(before, after, profile)` in `skinAnalysis.ts` that calls
the chat model with structured deltas + concerns/strengths and returns a 2-3
sentence natural-language summary. Falls back to a template-string narrative
if the API fails (never blocks the UI). Compare screen renders the result
inside a glass card with a sparkles icon, with skeleton placeholders during
loading.

### 🧠 Compare screen rewrite — `app/compare/index.tsx`

Old: tiny 60×60 thumbnails + flat metric bars. ~300 lines.

New: 
- PhotoCompareSlider hero (max 420px, square, dynamically sized)
- "Time elapsed" chip + scan-pickers row in a unified card
- Big animated Overall delta hero with twin score rings and arrow
- AI narrative card (glass variant)
- Twin SkinAgeBadge cards (when both scans are v2)
- DeltaGrid for all dimensions
- RegionalDeltaMap (when both scans have regional data)
- Skin-type / concerns / strengths chip card with before→after badges
- View Before / View After action buttons

Picker view also got a glow-up — uses Badge component to tag v2 scans.
Empty state now uses Button component with proper iconography.

### 📁 Files

**New**:
- `src/components/ui/PhotoCompareSlider.tsx` (~180 lines, Reanimated worklet)
- `src/components/ui/RegionalDeltaMap.tsx` (~230 lines)
- `src/components/ui/DeltaGrid.tsx` (~150 lines)

**Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/index.ts` — exports new components
- `src/services/skinAnalysis.ts` — added `narrateProgress()` function with retry + graceful fallback
- `app/compare/index.tsx` — full rewrite (~360 lines, was ~300)

### ✅ Verified

- `tsc --noEmit --strict` passes clean.
- Backwards compat preserved: v1 scans render via the old code paths; v2-only panels conditional on `schemaVersion === 2`.

## 2026-05-09 — v2 Scanner & Design System (Autonomous Overnight Pass 1)

### 🔬 Skin Scanner v2 — Clinical-Grade

The headline feature. Going from 7 dimensions → **16 clinical biomarkers** so we
match the depth of Haut.AI / Lóvi (the apps currently dominating the App Store
charts). Every new dimension is independently scored with its own AI confidence
rating — users now see not just *what* their skin score is but *how certain*
the model is.

**New score dimensions** (additive to v1 — back-compat preserved):
- `radiance` — luminosity / glow vs dullness
- `redness` — diffuse erythema (rosacea / inflammation)
- `darkSpots` — post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, sun damage
- `darkCircles` — periorbital pigmentation / vascular shadowing
- `wrinkles` — fine lines + expression lines
- `acne` — active blemishes (comedones / papules / pustules)
- `oiliness` — sebum production indicators
- `sensitivity` — visible reactivity / capillary fragility
- `barrierHealth` — lipid barrier integrity (flaking, tightness, dehydration)

**Regional analysis**: every scan now returns 7 zones (forehead, L/R cheek,
nose, chin, eye area, jawline) with severity (`none`/`mild`/`moderate`/`severe`)
and a one-line observation per zone.

**Skin age estimation**: AI-derived biological skin-age estimate with a bracket
classification (`younger`, `on-track`, `older`) — not a guess at chronological
age, only a clinical estimate from visible markers.

**Biomarker tags**: 3–6 concise diagnostic phrases per scan
("compromised barrier", "early UV damage", "vascular under-eye", etc.).

**Confidence scoring**: every metric carries a 0–100 confidence number that
visualizes how clearly the signal was visible in the photo.

**Photo quality preflight**: cheap client-side check (`src/services/photoQuality.ts`)
runs *before* the API call so unreadable photos don't burn a free scan. Server-side
AI returns a deeper quality assessment (`lighting`, `focus`, `faceDetected`,
`filterDetected`) which is merged with the client result.

**Retry logic**: vision and chat calls now retry on transient errors (network,
rate-limit, 5xx) with exponential backoff — no more single-blip scan failures.

**Schema versioning**: `SkinAnalysis.schemaVersion` tags each scan as v1 or v2 so
the UI can render legacy scans untouched while showcasing v2 panels for new ones.

### 🎨 Design System v2

**Tokens** (new — `src/constants/theme.ts`)
- Typography scale: display/h1/h2/h3/h4/body/bodyStrong/small/smallStrong/caption/micro
- Spacing scale: xxs (2) → giant (56)
- Radii scale: xs (6) → pill (999)
- Shadows: subtle / card / elevated / floating / glow
- Motion: durations + spring presets + press feedback constants
- Layout: screenPadding, cardPadding, sectionGap, itemGap, maxContentWidth

**Color palette** extended (`src/constants/colors.ts`)
- 9 new dimension-tints (one per v2 metric), tier badge colors, glass variants

**New UI primitives** in `src/components/ui/`
- `Card` — 6 variants: flat / elevated / glass / outline / gradient / glow
- `Button` — 5 variants × 3 sizes, with haptic feedback + spring press scale
- `Badge` — 8 tones, 3 sizes, optional pulsing dot for live states
- `Skeleton` — shimmer-loading placeholder for any size
- `Section` — title + caption + optional right-action header
- `MetricBar` — animated bar with confidence overlay + trend arrow

### 📊 Results Screen v2 Panels (additive)

When a v2 scan loads, three new panels render between the hero card and the
existing tabs:
1. **SkinAgeBadge** — gradient hero card showing biological skin-age with delta vs
   chronological age, animated counter on mount.
2. **BiomarkerCloud** — staggered chip cluster of biomarker tags.
3. **RegionalSkinMap** — anatomically-grounded face SVG with severity heatmap.
   Tap a region to see its specific finding. Pulses softly to draw attention to
   active concerns.

In the Scores tab, v2 scans now show the **16-dimension ScoreGrid** above the
legacy 6-bar list — horizontal-scrolling tiles with icon, value, confidence
indicator, and trend arrow vs prior scan.

Old scans render exactly as before (zero regression).

### ⚙️ Coach Improvements

The chat coach's system prompt now consumes v2 data: the model sees all 16
metrics, biomarker tags, and the estimated skin age. Advice is now grounded in
the user's actual scores ("your redness score of 62 suggests…") instead of
generic skin-type guidance.
